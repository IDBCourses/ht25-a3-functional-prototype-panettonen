# Puzzle Game

This game is inspired by the Rubik's cube.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The shortcut keys are corresponding to the keys on your keyboard layout. 

`T` - Hide/show timer  
`V` - Hide/show total moves

## Controls

The controls keys are based on the physical key locations, not the keyboard layout you use. The game has been tested on a US keyboard with a Colemak and a QWERTY layout. 

The keys represented here are based on the QWERTY layout. 

### Controlling the cube

Keys used:

```
Q W E
A S D
Z X C
```

Press and hold one of these key to select what row or column you want to move: 

`W` - Up  
`X` - Down  
`A` - Left  
`D` - Right  
`S` - Center  

Then by selecting a key near the key you are holding down, the cubes move in the direction of the newly pressed key. 

For example, if you press and hold `X` and then press `C`, you move the bottom row to the right one step.

### Change the color scheme

Keys used:

```
6 7 8 9
Y U I O
H J K L
N M , .
```

By swiping down on these keys, it will change between the color schemes. 

For it to work, at least 3 keys need to have been pressed.
